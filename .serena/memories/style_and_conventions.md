- Source is TypeScript (ES2022 target) bundled by Vite in strict mode; expect full type coverage, no implicit anys, and no unused locals/params.
- Module format is ESNext with bundler-style resolution; imports should use explicit extensions only when required and stay tree-shake friendly.
- Code generally keeps logic modular inside `packages/<renderer>-sequence` directories; follow existing patterns within peer renderer implementations when adding new code.
- Aim to keep files ASCII-only unless absolutely required per repo instructions.
